The AGD metal detector project is a DIY project for the electronics for a dual channel pulse injection metal detector using sample and hold technology. It is of analog design that is capable of detecting the small gold typically found in Alaska. The design allows for the use search coils that are designed to be used for the GPX 5000 which have a inductance of around 300uH. Testing of the electronics was completed with CoilTek 9 and 14 inch Elite mono coils and a Detech 8 inch DD coil.

This project is very complex and requires good knowledge of electronics, suitable enclosure design, proper equipment for installing the surface mount components, and suffcient test equipment for intial alignment. There are 3 circuit boards, RX and logic board, TX board and an Interface board for the front panel user controls. 

I designed this project because I did not want a metal detector that has a digital display and instead has standard controls where you can see seting in one glance. Power is supplied by a 12 volt 10ah LIFePO4 Lithium battery carried like the GPX 5000. I use two of these detectors and added 4 inch speakers into the enclosures. This was for flexibily but added substantial weight. The eclosure gets mounted at the rear of the shaft with GPX 5000 hardware. The detect tone output is a sine wave that idles at 300hZ after power up stabilization is completed. It will increase in frequency in response to having detected metal.

It takes a good deal of time to assemble this project and the parts costs are not inexpensive. I'm happy with the performance and its ability to respond to small gold. Since like the GPX 5000 there is the cord to the battery pack to deal with. I find that a fairly long none curly cord to be the best. Internally battey power is regulated to plus and minus 10 volts and most of the electronic components use those regulated voltages.

This project is just for assembly of the circuit boards other items required are readily available from vendors that normally sell those items and can will vary depending on the builders desires.

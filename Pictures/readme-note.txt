This folder will contain pictures related to my AGD  "Alaska Gold Detector" project.

I have been working on this project for several years and final minor changes
have been made to the TX and RX circuit boards.
 I'm presently working on the
circuit board for the front panel controls and switches. In the past wiring
these up was rather time consuming and I think that the circuit board will
make it a simpler and cleaner installation. The circuit board will interface
to the RX board by wire pigtails and connectors. The controls and switches
will solder into the board and form a complete unit.

Only the power connector and the on/off switch will be seperate.

It is expected that final circuit boards for this project will be on hand
by the end of January 2023.

I will post some pictures in the near future.
